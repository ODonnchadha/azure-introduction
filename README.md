## INTRODUCTION TO AZURE

- INTRODUCTION:
  = "To the cloud!" Managed services. Managed solutions. Used somewhere else.
    - Fault tolerance: Redundancy. Backups.
    - High availability: Sharing.
    - Scalability: Forecast versus automatic scaling. On-demand resources. With peak hours.
    - Elasticity: Reverse of scalability. Reduce to meet need at that moment.
      - Grow and shrink to meet ongoing needs.

- AZURE ORGANIZATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE:
  - "Organization and relationships."
  - What is Azure? Microsoft's public cloud computing platform.
    - Two hundred individual products and services.
    - Build, run, and manage applications on Microsoft's *global* infrastruction:
      - Infrastructure as a Service: IaaS.
      - Platform as a Service: PaaS. (Managed services.)
      - Software as a Service: SaaS. (Managed services.)
      - Pay-as-you-go pricing. No up-front commitment for resources.
        - Operational expense.
  - Azure Global Infrastructure:
    - Datacenter infrastructure:
    - Breakdown between regions and availability zones:
      - Region: Group of datacenters in a single geographic location.
      - Availability zone: One of several unique physical locations in a region.
        - Providing an addditional layer of fault tolerance.
  - Azure Services:
    - Available business (managed) services. Via portal page.
      - Solutiuons. Services.
      - IaaS: Virtual servers. You maintain OS.
      - PaaS: Cloud vendor maintains infrastructure. You focus on code and data.
      - SaaS: Vendor provides full software stack.
    - Azure Resource Manager (ARM.):
      - Interaction: SDKs. ARM: Single portal. Centralized management layer.
        - CLI. Application access. Authentication.
  - Resource Hierarchy and Organization:
    - Organization:
      - Tenant: Management Groups: Subscriptions: Resource Groups: Resources.
        - Access and policies granted to parrents are inherited by child levels.
        - A child can only have one parent. Similiar to OS file structure.
    - Tracking: (Segmentating.) Payment.
    - Limiting: Access to different sets of resources. Or not.
  - Identity and Access Management. (IAM:)
    - Who? Azure Active Directory. (Azure AD,) Cloud-based identity service.
      - One per tenant. Who are you? Identity equals 'security principle.'
      = Manage end users (people) or applications.
      - End user: email format.
    - Can do what? Azure Role-Based Access COntrol. (Azure RBAC.)
      - Access controlled via roles. "What are you allowed to do?"
      - Assign roles to a security principle.
      - Roles are collections of specific permissions.
      = Roles: General and specific types.
    - On which resources? Scope. Scope of access in resource heirarchy.
      - The set of resources allowed to access. "On which resources?"
      - Roles granted to various layers of resource heirarchy.
      - Lower levels inherit roles from higher levels.
  - Monitoring Your Azure Environment:
    - Are resources performing as expected?
    - Are there errors I need to be aware of?
    - Who is making changes to my cloud environment?
    - Azure Monitor: Cloud visiility. "What's happening?"
      - Logs: Text-based event(s) record(s).
        - "Who created the resource and when?" "Why is Windows throwing an error?"
      - Metrics:
        - Telemetry-based performance data:
          - CPU Utilization. Latency.

- CORE SERVICES:
  - Fundamental building blocks:
  - Virtual machines (Compute:) IaaS.
    - Azure: Physical hardware and networking. 
      - Base OS image. Hypervisor (virtualization) management.
    - Company: Updating/patching OS and installed software. 
      - OS access and management. Software installation.
    - Trade-off: Flexibility versus less management (managed.)
      - VM replication. If VM goes down, a copied VM can take over. Via zones.
    - Scale set. Multiple copies of VMs. (With load balancer.)
      - Enables scaling and elasticity.
  - Networking:
    - Virtual network. (VNet.) "Home network" Internal and external adresses.
      - Provides public or private netwrok communication among Azure resources.
      - Private network uses internal IP addresses to communicate.
      - Subnet: Segment multiple resources for precise organization.
      - Peering/VPN/Express route: 
        - Connect to other Azure VNets across regions, on-premises networks, or other cloud networks.
      - Network security groups/firewall:
        - Control access to VNet resources by network protocol, port, or source locations.
  - Storage: Blob. Queues. Files. Disks. Tables (Sort of)
    - DBs are technically a different type of storage.
    - Storage account. All-purpose storage solution for multiple data storage scenarios.
    - Resource group - Storage account - Sub-service type. (More than one.)
    - BLOB: Binary large object.
      - Object storage. Unstructured data. All file types. Images. Videos.
    - Files: Network file share in the cloud.
    - Disks: Virtual hard drives for VMs.
    - Queues: Asynchronous messaging between apps and services.
    - Tables: NoSQL database storage. Gradually transitioning to Cosmos DB.
    - e.g.: MUSIC APPLICATION - Storage Account - Audio files.
  - Database And Analytics:
    - NOTE: Both core and managed services.
    - SQL, Azure Synapse analytics, Cosmos DB, SQL Stretch Database.
    - Azure cache for Redis, Table stroage, Azure search.
    - DB: Structured data: e.g.: User directory. Transactional records. Product catalog.
    - PaaS: Multiple managed database services.
      - Azure SQL, COsmos DB, Managed MySQL/PostgreSQL, etc.
      - SQL versus NoSQL. 
      - "Fully managed" versus provisioned infrastructure.
      - Single region versus multiple regions.
      - Open source versus proprietary.
    - NOTE: Seperating storage from compute.
      - Music Application <-> SQL Database. (User names and passwords.)
      - Music Application <-> Storage Account.
      - Music Application <-> Azure Cosmos DB (Music Catalog.) <-> Audio Files.
    - Analytics: (& IoT)
      - Analyzing data for insight. Massive amounts of queried data.
      - e.g.:
        - BUsiness Intelligence <-> Azure Synapse (Query & Visualization.) <-> Azure Data Lake (Customer Metrics.)
  - App Service And Serverless Compute:
    - Music Application hosted on VM. IaaS.
    - Full flexibility, but with a cost of increased responsibilitity.
      - OS updates & patching.
      - Compute (CPU/RAM) and storage management.
      - Scaling via VM scale sets.
    - VERSUS: Application code with Azure handling everything else:
      - Web Apps: App service = "serverless" compute.
      - Azure controls 100% of the virtual machine. We update and push code.
      - App service supports multiple languages and conyainers. But VMs are more flexible.
      - App service is a developer/coding tool. 100% cpding-focused.

- POWER OF CLOUD COMPUTING:
  - Azure Managed Services:
    - IaaS: Management responsibility:
    - Azure VM = Server (Application Hosting) =
      - [CPU, RAM, Hard Drive/Storage, Network Card, Firewall (Security), OS]
    - Managed service = managed solutions.
    - EXAMPLE: SQL:
      - Azure: OS backups/patching. Backups.
      - You: Compute and storage configuration. Loading and working with the data.
    - Container/Kubernetes Services:
      - Self-contained, portable, software packaging mechnaism. Not dependent upon underlying OS.
      - Kubernetes: Populare container orchestration service.
    - AI/Machine Learning:
      - Managed machine learning services. Enable applications to automatically recognize patterns.
        - e.g.: Image recognition. Pre-trained services or build your own custom model.
    - Big Data: Abilitity to analyze massive amounts of data for business results.
      - Terabytes. Petabytes.
      - HDInsight: Fully managed Hadoop/Spark ecosystem.
      - Azure Synapse: Query massive amounts of data in fully serverless format.
      - Power BI. SaaS dashboards for visualizing data analytics.
    - IoT. Internet-connected objects. Smart doorbells. Tempature sensors. Self-driving cars.
      - Solutions for the entire collection process:
        - Ingestion. Storage. Analysis. Ingrates with big data tools.
  - Cloud Advantage Scenarios:
    - Fault tolerance. (Redundancy/resiliency.)
    - High availability.
    - Scalability.
    - Elasticity.
